# GLM and non-parametric methods analysis for predicting best indicators for asthma hospitalization in the United States

Notebooks completed in Jupyter Description: 

1) Data cleaning - Cleaning datasets across 5 different states in the United States with publicly available data on asthma hospitalization accounts and merging with PM2.5, ozone, and demographic data to form a comprehensive csv file containing predictors and the dependent variable in preparation for running a generalized linear model (GLM). 
2) GLM - On the cleaned dataset, running a comparison of GLM (frequentist method) in comparison to a nonparametric method (random forest and decision tree) to see which models perform with the lowest RMSE. Also determine which variables/predictors are most important for predicting hospitalization counts due to asthma for each respective model.
